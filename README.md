Book Collection is a cozy web app built to help readers track their reading journeys. Whether you're logging a new read, jotting down reflections, or browsing books shared by others, this app keeps everything in one bookish place.

I wanted something that felt both functional and personal—like a digital bookshelf with notes in the margins.
